# 🧑‍💻 Aidan Hildebrand — Developer in Progress

Hey there! I'm Aidan, a software developer with a background in logistics and training. I recently graduated from Flatiron School’s immersive software engineering program, where I sharpened my skills in Python, JavaScript, React, Flask, and SQL.

Before switching lanes into tech, I worked as a truck driver trainer. That taught me how to stay calm under pressure, explain complex ideas clearly, and always keep systems running smoothly. Now I bring those same skills into every project I work on.
